# GradeToGates

GradeToGates is an R-based statistical analysis project exploring the impact of high school grades on college choices, focusing on the distribution between public and private institutions.

## Project Description

This analysis uses the R programming language, along with the `tidyverse` and `lubridate` packages, to process and analyze a dataset containing freshmen survey responses. The goal is to investigate how different high school grades correlate with the selection of public versus private colleges.

## Key Analysis

- **Data Parsing**: Clean and prepare the survey data for analysis.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Apply binomial distributions and hypothesis testing to understand patterns in college choices.
- **Insight Discovery**: Reveal significant insights that could potentially inform educational policy and highlight considerations of equity in college admissions.
